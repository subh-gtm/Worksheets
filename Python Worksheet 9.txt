Q11 to Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook. 

11. Write a Pandas program to create and display a DataFrame from the following dictionary data and labels 
    exam_data = {'name' ['Anastasia', 'Dima', 'Katherine', 'James', 'Emily', 'Michael', 'Matthew', 'Laura', 'Kevin','Jonas'], 
    'score' [12.5, 9, 16.5, np.nan, 9, 20, 14.5, np.nan, 8, 19], 
    'attempts' [1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1], 
    'qualify' ['yes', 'no', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'yes', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'yes']}
     labels = ['I’, ‘II’, ‘III’, ‘IV’, ‘V’, ‘VI’, ‘VII’, ‘VIII’, ‘IX’, ‘X’] 

Answer11: import pandas ad pd
          import numpy as np
          df = pd.DataFrame(exam_data) 
          df
12. Write a Pandas program to get the first 5 rows of the DataFrame created in Q11. 

Answer12: df.head(5)

13. Write a Pandas program to select the 'name' and 'score' columns of the DataFrame created in Q11. 

Answer13: df[["name","score"]]

14. Write a Pandas program to select 'name' and 'score' columns in row indexes 3, 5, 6, 8 from the DataFrame 
    created in Q11. 

Answer14: df.iloc[[3,5,6,8],[0,1]]

15. Write a Pandas program to select the rows where the score is between 15 and 20 (inclusive) from the 
    DataFrame created in Q11. 
 
Answer15: df.loc[(df['score'] > 15) & (df['score'] <= 20), ['score']]
