Q11 is subjective answer type question, answer it briefly. 


11. List any two major differences between lists and sets in python. 
Answer11:
    1. List can be 2-D whereas a set can't 2-D.
    2. As list are ordered (in serial number) list are comparatively slow to execute whereas sets are fast.
    3. Printing a set almost always provide different sequence of output.
    4. Set uses hash function to find an element whereas list is an array. Hence finding element in Set is faster than in list.


Q12 to Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook. 

12. write a python program to square the elements of a list by using list comprehension. 
Answer12:

13. Write a pyhton program to drop duplicate elements from a list of numbers. 
Answer13:

14. Take two sets of numbers and try implementing the set operations - intersection, union, difference and 
     symmetric_difference between them. 
Answer14:

15.  Write a python program to add the elements of a set. 
Answer15:
