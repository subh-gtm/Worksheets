Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly 

11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary. 

Answer:List is a collection which is Ordered and changeable list allows duplicate numbers.
 Tuple  is a collection which is Ordered and unchangeable.  it allows duplicate numbers.
 Set is a collectionWhich is an Ordered and an  unindexed no duplicate memo.
 Dictionary is a collection which is   unordered changeable and indexed know duplicate members.
 

 List of just like the array declared in other languages
 list need to be homogeneous always which makes it a most powerful tool in Python 
 Single list may contain data types like integers strings as well as object
 List are mutable and hence they can be altered even after their creation

 The elements of a list are mutable whereas the element of a  tuple  are immutable
 when we do not want to change the data over time  the tuple  is a preferred data type
 Lterating  the elements of a tuple  a is faster compared to iterating  to over a list
 Elements of a tuple  are enclosed in parenthesis  where as the element of list are enclosed in square bracket.

 To define a set in python ,we have to used the "{ }" curly Brackets . 
 In set there is no proper sequence of elements and here we can add and remove
 the elements .set is immutable data type in Python where change is possible after defining set

 Use {} curly brackets to construct the dictionary, and [] square brackets to index it. 
 Separate the key and value with colons: and with commas, between each pair. 
 Keys must be quoted As with lists we can print out the dictionary by printing the reference to it. 
 A dictionary maps a set of objects (keys) to another set of objects (values). 
 A Python dictionary is a mapping of unique keys to values. Dictionaries are mutable, which means they can be changed. 
 The values that the keys point to can be any Python value. Dictionaries are unordered, so the order that 
 the keys are added doesn’t necessarily reflect what order they may be reported back.


12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, write a small code to replace ‘+’ 
with space in python. 

Answer: strings is immutable. we can't overwrite the values of immutable objects.
we can assign the variable again. It's not modifying the string object; it's creating a new string object.

 text = "I+Love+Python"
        text=text.replace("+"," ")
        print(text)

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting 
the datatype of a variable in python. 

Answer: The ord() function is used to get an integer representing the Unicode code point of that character.
when the argument is a unicode object, or the value of the byte when the argument is an 8-bit string.
The syntax can be ord(“D”) or ord(‘D’), both will give same results. 

function for getting the datatype of a variable in python:
print(ord('s'))
Output: 115

x="Hello"
type(x)
output: int

x="Hello"
type("x")
output: str

x=0.457
type(x)
Output: float

x=("dog","animal")
type(x)
output: tuple

x={1,"animal"}
type(x)
output: set

x={"dog":"animal"}
type(x)
output: dict

x=["dog","animal"]
type(x)
output: list


Q14 and Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook. 

14. Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form 𝑎𝑥 2 + 𝑏𝑥+ 𝑐= 0. Where a, b and c are to 
be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‘a’ should not be equal to 0. 

Answer: import cmath
import sys


#input from the user
a=int(input('Enter Value of a: '))
if  int(a) > 0:
    print()
else:
    print("a Value should be greater than 1. Program Terminated")
    sys.exit()
b = int(input('Enter Value of b: '))
c = int(input('Enter value of c: '))

# calculation
d = (b**2) - (4*a*c)

# find two solutions
type1 = (-b-cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)
type2 = (-b+cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)

print('Quardic Equation Solution as Follows {1} and {0}'.format(type1,type2))



15. Write a python program to find the sum of first ‘n’ natural numbers without using any loop. Ask user to input 
the value of ‘n’.

Answer: val=input("Enter Value of n ")
val=input("Enter Value ")
n=int(val)
sum = ((n*n)+n)/2;
print("Sum of Natural Numbers: ",sum)
