Q11 to Q15 are subjective answer type questions, Answer them briefly. 

11. What is data-warehouse? 

Answer: A single and complete and consistent store of data obtain from a variety of different sources made 
available to end users in a what they can understand and use in a business context. A process of transferming data into 
information and making it available to users in a timely enough manner to make a difference. 
It is a rational and multidimensional database management system designed to support mamagment decision making. A data warehousing 
is a copy of transaction data specifically structured for quearing and reporting. Technique for assembling and managing data from various source
for the purpose of answering business questions. Thus making decision that were not previous possible. 


12. What is the difference between OLTP VS OLAP? 
Answer: OLAP(Online Analytical Processing) is a powerful technology for data discovery, including capabilities for limitless report viewing, complex analytical calculations and
preditive "what if" scenario planning.

OLTP(Online Transaction processing): it supports the daily business operations. It is a database which must typically allow the real time processing
of SQL transaction to support traditional processes E-commerce and time critical applications.

OLTP Processing Speed is typically very fast. but OLAP system speed depends on amount of data involved.
OLTP Database design highly normalized with many tables. In OLAP database design is typically de-normalized.
OLTP: operational Data is the original source of data. OLAP: consolidation data, it comes from various OLTP Databases.
OLTP: to control and run fundamental business tasks. OLAP: it helps with planning, problem solving and decision support.
OLTP: Short and fast inserts and updates initiated by end users. OLAP: Periodic long running batch jobs refresh the data.     
 

13. What are the various characteristics of data-warehouse? 

Answer: -Data Warehouse is subject oriented. It provides information on a topic rather than ongoing operation of organizations.
it emphasized modeling and analyzing decision making data.
-Data Warehouse means establishing a standard unit of measurment from the different databases for all. it must also keep naming conversation,
format and coding consistent. 
-Data warehouse is quite expensive. the data collected in a data warehouse is acknowlwdge over a given period and provides historical information.
-Data warehouse is a non volatile means that provide data will not be erased when new data are entered into it. data is read only, only updated regularly.    
   

14. What is Star-Schema?? 

Answer: Star schema: The most common modeling paradigm is the star schema, 
in which the data warehouse contains (1) a large central table (fact table ) containing the bulk of the 
data, with no redundancy, and (2) a set of smaller attendant tables (dimension tables ), one for each 
dimension. The schema graph resembles a starburst, with the dimension tables displayed 
in a radial pattern around the central fact table.


15. What do you mean by SETL?

Answer:  is a type of data integration that refers to the three steps (extract, transform, load) used to 
blend data from multiple sources. It's often used to build a data warehouse. During this process, data is 
taken (extracted) from a source system, converted (transformed) into a format that can be analyzed, and stored 
(loaded) into a data warehouse or other system. Extract, load, transform (ELT) is an alternate but related approach 
designed to push processing down to the database for improved performance.
